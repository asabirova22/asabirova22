# Hi! My name is Adelya 

**Student. Engineer. Believer. Above all, human.**

I’m currently a junior at the University of Rochester, double majoring in Computer Science and Finance. This spring, I’ll be studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Queen Mary University of London, UK.

### About Me
-  **Research Interests**: Time complexity analysis, optimization, memory management, and cache locality, with applications in computational electromagnetics, signal processing, and networked systems. Interests include efficient algorithms for solving Maxwell’s equations, optimization in electromagnetic wave propagation, spectral methods in signal analysis, and numerical techniques for large-scale system modeling. 2024 Summer Research Assistant under Professor Chen Ding (REU NSF Funding).
-  **Conference Attendance**: Grace Hopper Tech Conference, Philadelphia 2024.

### Technical Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Java, JavaScript, C, Python, Swift, R, SQL, HTML, CSS
- **Simulation & Computational Tools**: COMSOL Multiphysics, MATLAB, ANSYS, Simulink
- **Operating Systems**: Linux (shell scripting, Bash, Fedora, Red Hat, Ubuntu), Windows

### Outside of Academia
As a Rochester, NY native-- I love the outdoors and am often found in the Finger Lakes region of Upstate NY. I enjoy cycling, running, and swimming (triathlete pending…).
